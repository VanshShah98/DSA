what are algos? It is the final set of information.used to solve problems ; Sequence of operations is used to carry out inorder to solve a specific problem.
Charactristics of algorithms:
1)input
2)output
3)definedness
4)finiteness
5)effectiveness 
Q1)write an algorithms for adding 2 number.
Q2)finding the largest of the three number.

Time complexity and space
Time taken to execute each statement of the code in an algorithm
2 methods to measure:
a) step count/frequency count method: analysing the time complexity; number of times you're checking how many number of times an instruction is getting executed.
-for loop: 1
-if statement: 1
-parenthesis: 0
-while statement: 0
-break/continue/ go to: 1
-switch statement: 1
Example:- Algo for the Sum of elements of array 

b) operational count: analysing efficiency of the algo thru counting the no. of basic operations
